/*
    API for CHILS

    You can either construct the graph using the add_vertex
    and add_edge functions or provide a graph directly on
    the CSR format. After construction, there are two
    functions to run either CHILS with N solutions or just
    the local search (recommended for low time limits). To
    get the independent set, use the functions prefixed by
    chils_solution_.

    Note that you need to call chils_free to free the
    memory used by the heuristic. Also, note that only one
    form of graph construction should be used. That is,
    either add edges and vertices or set the CSR graph
    directly. You can not give a CSR graph and then add
    more vertices or edges.
